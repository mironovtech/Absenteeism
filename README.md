The idea of the project is to get the instrument, which can predict an absense of company employees based on a number of factors.

The initial raw historical data were preprocessed, separated to train and test data, and then used for ML-model training.
Finally, the ML-model was used for predictions based on new data set.
The model prediction accuracy on the presented data set achieved 75%.
The visualisation of data was performed using Tableau.
